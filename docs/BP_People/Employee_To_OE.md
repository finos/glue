## Data Dictionary - Entity Table: `Employee_To_OE`

From a business perspective, responsibilities within a bank can belong to an individual employee or several teams (direct responsibilities).

 But it is also common within the organizational structure of a bank for Employee and OE-Organizational Entity,  
 
 to share responsibilities e.g: as a supervisor of a team or as a member of a team. 

Examples of OE relations (how an OE/Employee relates to another OE/Employee): 

Members: Several employees typically form a team. An employee is represented by a Employee id and a team is represented by an OE-Organizational Entity id.

Supervisor: The members of a team are typically controlled by a team lead. Similarly, all other teams/divisions from higher up in the 

organizational hierarchy have a manager who is responsible for all underlying organizational entities.
