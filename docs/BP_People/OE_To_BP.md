## Data Dictionary - Entity Table: OE_To_BP

Enter the OE- organizational entity to BP-Business Partner Type

The responsibility of an employee/OE-Organizational entity for a customer of the bank is modeled via responsibility relations.

The organizational structure drives security. So, a Job User's data access is determined by his Job's responsibility relations. 

Examples: 

- Direct Responsibilities:		

Bank employees are modeled as person subtype "Job" and teams/divisions are modeled as person subtype "OE". 

Every object can have an OE/Job set as its responsible person (responsible). This relation between an OE/Job object and another object is called a direct responsibility.				

- Derived Responsibilities:				

Responsibility for one object can subsequently include responsibilities for related objects (e.g. the BP related to a certain OE). 

This type of responsibility is called derived responsibility within the organizational structure.				

The object that has a directly responsible OE/Job is the starting point. On the basis of this object, it is possible to customize 

the related objects for which derived responsibility will be calculated.
